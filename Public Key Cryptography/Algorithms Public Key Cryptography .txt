--> RSA and ECDSA are two widely used algorithms for public key cryptography.

--> RSA is based on factoring the product of two prime numbers, while ECDSA uses elliptic curves.

--> ECDSA can provide the same level of security with smaller key sizes compared to other public key algorithms.

--> Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve for digital signing, which is based on ECDSA.
